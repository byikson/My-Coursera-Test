					Hello everyone, my name is Solomon Ihediohanma, and welcome to my course, JavaScript: Getting Started. I am a software consultant and developer in the Portland, Oregon area. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. According to GitHub, JavaScript is the top programming language, and it's more than twice as popular as the runner-up, Python. Learning the JavaScript language is valuable for any developer. JavaScript is the language of the web supported by all major browsers, but tools exist to take JavaScript far beyond web pages. You can create native smartphone and tablet apps, desktop apps for Windows and Mac, and even server-side apps using JavaScript.
